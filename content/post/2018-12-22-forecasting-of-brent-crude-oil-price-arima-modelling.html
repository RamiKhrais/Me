<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Crude oil is almost the most important commodities in the world. It is widely considered to be the lifeblood of our modern life and the crucial driver behind the radical transformations in the global economy over the last decades. The crude oil and its products are almost used in every single industry ranging from aviation to petrochemical. The world currently produces approximately 93 million barrels per day. The market of crude is bigger than all raw metal markets combined at approximate value of 1.7 trillion dollar a year. Given this exceptional importance, the price of crude oil is one of the key determinant of the global economic activity, the international trade, the stock prices, and the macroeconomic policies adopted by the countries worldwide. It has therefore been a subject of a great deal of research. An enormous number of governmental and international agencies, consultancies, hedge funds and think-tanks are always busy designing and evaluating the best approaches to forecast the crude oil prices and to capture its volatile trends. In this project, I will build an econometric model in order to study the dynamics of monthly Brent oil prices for the period from 1987 to 2018 using the <a href="https://ramikh.netlify.com/post/forecasting-of-brent-crude-oil-price-arima-modelling/">Box-Jenkins method</a>. I will use several ARIMA models in order to assess their forecasting performances using the relevant statistical tests and techniques. The data for this project is obtained from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) for the spot price of Brent crude in Europe in American Dollar for the mentioned period.
