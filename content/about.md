<p style='text-align: justify;'>This me Rami. I hold a master degree in Economics from Exeter University, UK. I've worked previously as upstream oil and gas analyst and as economic researcher as well. Through my career path, I've gained a good experience in modelling oil and gas assets and analysing the main trends in energy markets. Dealing with data has always been part of my job and I've always been interested in extracting meaningful insights from datasets and visualising them in artistic way. By the time, I came to realize how data is going to change our world at almost every single level and how it is going to be deeply integrated in a wide spectrum of fields. I thus decided to take the challenge and to sharpen my existing skills in data analysis and to gain new ones. That is, I decided to be a newdiver in data ocean.</p>
