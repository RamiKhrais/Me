      <description>This me Rami. I hold a master degree in Economics from Exeter University, UK. I&#39;ve worked previously as upstream oil and gas analyst and as economic researcher as well. Through my career path, I&#39;ve gained a good experience in modelling oil and gas assets and analysing the main trends in energy markets.</description>
